'''
this is a simple interface for getting answers to questions
since brainly uses javascript to render their search page,
and datadome does a pretty good job of blocking headless browsers,
im just going to leave it using manual input for answers for now.
all you really have to do is click the link and copy paste, so its not
too bad, and plus my original solution had you copying the datadome cookie
from a real browser to the cli anyway, so was never fully automatic
im sure theres a better way but this works for now.

    i know specificness is dumb. thats why i used it.
    specificness is on a scale from 0 to 100, 0 being everything matches and 100 being only exact matches

    example call: print(query('who was thomas jefferson')['answer'])
